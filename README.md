# filetypecheck
Bash script to check for and automatically correct file extension based on mimetype

Do you have incorrectly labelled files? Why do I even ask? Of course you do. I bet some days you can't even be bothered to brush behind your premolars, you begrimed paragon of unkemptness.

Worry no more. This helpful bash script allows you the distinct pleasure of being able to correct image file extensions with one command when whatever image viewer you use talks about simpler times when developers didn't want to have their programs to check for mimetypes in the file. 

Go on. Mislabel something. **I should probably try and market this to someone at tumblr**

Usage:
    filetypecheck -c (Correct extension errors) -a (Display files with correct extensions as well)
